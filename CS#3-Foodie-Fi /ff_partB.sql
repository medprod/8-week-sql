--1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS total_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;

--2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset use the start of the month as the group by value
SELECT COUNT(p.plan_id) AS total_subscriptions, date_trunc('month',s.start_date) AS month_start
FROM foodie_fi.plans p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
GROUP BY date_trunc('month',s.start_date)
ORDER BY month_start;

--3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
SELECT COUNT(p.plan_id), p.plan_name, date_trunc('month',s.start_date) AS month_start 
FROM foodie_fi.plans p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE date_part('month',s.start_date) > 2020

--4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE s.plan_id = 4) AS total_churned,
